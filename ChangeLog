	  been set aside on the TWiki to inform developers on which platforms
	  the Tk has been built successfully.

	- The Tk now builds successfully on Mac OSX using jam and make

	- Added a library /dev/lib/procframe/ (from Processing Framework)
	  under which all pre-existing classes related to GNSS Data 
	  Structures (GDS) have been moved out of /src/.

Version 1.4   Tuesday, December 18, 2007

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Majority of version 1.4 comprised of revision number 863 
	  branching took place under revision 864 from dev/ to RC1.4/
	
	- Major refactoring of the Ephemeris/Almanac classes. This change may 
	  break some apps. To fix them the following translations are useful:
	
              Old                           |        New
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    gpstk::EphemerisStore		    | gpstk::XvtStore<gpstk::SatID>
    gpstk::BCEphemerisStore		    | gpstk::GPSEphemerisStore
    gpstk::AlmanacStore                     | gpstk::GPSAlmanacStore
    gpstk::EphemerisStore::NoEphemerisFound | gpstk::InvalidRequest
    eph.getSatXvt(sat, time)	            | eph.getXvt(sat, time)
    eph.getSatXvt(prn, time)		    | eph.getXvt(SatID(prn, SatID::systemGPS), time)
    eph.dump(0, cout)			    | eph.dump(cout, 0)


        - Added an updated LaTeX source for table describing apps of v1.3, 
	        as well as a list of classes in the gpstk libraries 
	        (sorted & categorized) found in ref/glance/

	- Added LeTex source for the GPSTk paper at the ION-GNSS-2006

	- Added a library /dev/lib/vplot/ to create drawing primitives in SVG 
	        and postscript formats. Intended to support complex, fully 
	        customizable visualizations on GNSS analyses. Supported only 
	        in jam for now,	but with the hope of support in make.

	- Improved version control 
	  * set gpstk package version to 1.3 in the autoconf build world
	  * set the current shared library major version to 13, so gpstk 1.3
	    delivers lib{gpstk,rxio,mdplib,...}.so.13.0
	  * now allows jam and make to build shared libraries with the 
	    appropriate versions
	  * causes jam to install headers to $PREFIX/include/gpstk to prevent 
	    header namespace collision. This behaviour is consistent with the 
	    "make" build.

	- Moved apps/geomatics/lib library to dev/lib/geomatics

	- Complete rewrite and move of apps/cycleslips/DiscFix
	  Located now in apps/geomatics/cycleslips/DiscFix
	  	DiscFix is now much more object-oriented, faster, more robust
		and more accurate.  Significant changes have been made to the
		algorithm.

		A tool for calculating SV position, azimuth and
		elevation from a navigation file
	
	- Added apps/converters/novaRinex
		A NovAtel binary to Rinex converter

		Added -r (RINEX) input capability
	
	- Added apps/qa/Expression
		A fully functional expression interpreter
	
	- Added apps/qa/obsrip
		A utility which transforms RINEX files into linear combos, ect.
	
	- Added functionality to apps/multipath/ObsArray
		Can track observations by PRN and by epoch.  Also can insert
		GPS constants into Expressions.
		
	- Added apps/positioning/posInterp
		This application interpolates positions in a RINEX file, increasing
		the data rate by an integer factor.  An example that uses both
		posInterp and PRSolve is included.
	
	- Added apps/visibility/findMoreThan12
		A new tools which given an ephemeris source, finds times when there are
		more than 12 SVs simultaneously above a specified elevation angle.
	
	- Improved apps/positioning/rinexpvt
		Added optional log file to output
		Added option to set observation rate to other than 30s
		
	
Version 1.1   Friday, January 7, 2005

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Added patches to support more compilers:
	     GNU compiler version 3.4
	     GNU compiler under AIX
	     Sun ONE Studio 8

	- GNU make/configure capabilities have been added. Since this
	  is a new feature, your mileage may vary. The makefiles
	  work on systems with newer autoconf toolchain versions.

	- More examples were added to gpstk/examples.
	  These examples are described in the website.

	- Major revamp of the website.
	
	Library modifications
	---------------------

	- P code generator was allocating over 20 megabytes in
	  processes that use the shared library. Now the 20 megabytes
	  are not allocated until the P code generator is initialized
	  by the user.
	
	- Bug fix: FileSpec::extractDayTime() now initializes
	  DayTimes generated from file name to have zero hours,
	  zero minutes, zero seconds, etc.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS now more robust when accepting
	  a year number as a hint to disambiguate which full GPS
	  week to use.
	
	- Added more DayTime tests.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime user-defined tolerance for comparisons now is
	  working.

	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS(short week, long zcount, short year)
	  now works across a year rollover.
	
	- Renamed WxObsData::find(...) to getWxObservation(...) to remove
	  any confusion that might develop over having the same method
	  name as the STL.
	
	- Bug fix: satellite combinations in RAIM sometimes incorrect when 
	  a user-marked satellite was present.

	- Some Vector routines were throwing Exception instead of 
	  VectorException.

	- Added Vector-Matrix concatentation operators.

	- Added a sub-Vector constructor.

	- Modification to Householder decomposition routine.
	
	- Various fixes to MatrixOperators.

	- Updates to FIC routines.

	- Implemented azimuth and elevation functions in Position, making 
	  use of the functions inherited from Triple. Modified EphemerisRange
	  to use Position, as well as TropModel and ResCor; this eliminated 
	  a bug in the azimuth() in EphemerisRange and means that now there 
	  is only one implementation of az and el. Added a test of the new 
	  routines in positiontest. Also added a Position constructor from Xvt.

	- Bugs in DayTime::setToString() - %f was missing (!) and %S 
	  was acting as %f should; date was trashed when time was set, 
	  and vice versa, and year input was not properly handled.

	- Implemented ionospheric model types other than linear.

	- Cleaned up weather data handling (e.g., error checks).

	
	Application modifications
	-------------------------
	
	apps/difftools

	- Unified code using a common class.


	apps/filetools

	- Improvments to navdmp.

	- New utility called rinexthin for subsampling RINEX observation
	  files.

	
	apps/binding
	
	- This  new project provides GPSTk bindings in other languages
	  has been added. This capability is in an alpha state.
	  Currently there are a limited set of bindings for
	  Tcl/Tk, Python and Octave.

	
	apps/RinexEditor

	-  Bug fix: 'delete all' command was being deleted prematurely.


	apps/RinexPlot

	- Improved documentation.

	- Various tweaks.

	- Plotting improvements.


	apps/ionosphere

	- Various improvements.
