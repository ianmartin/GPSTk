Version 1.1   Friday, January 7, 2005

	General modifications
        ---------------------

	- Added patches to support more compilers:
	     GNU compiler version 3.4
	     GNU compiler under AIX
	     Sun ONE Studio 8

	- GNU make/configure capabilities have been added. Since this
	  is a new feature, your mileage may vary. The makefiles
	  work on systems with newer autoconf toolchain versions.

	- More examples were added to gpstk/examples.
	  These examples are described in the website.

	- Major revamp of the website.
	
	Library modifications
	---------------------

	- P code generator was allocating over 20 megabytes in
	  processes that use the shared library. Now the 20 megabytes
	  are not allocated until the P code generator is initialized
	  by the user.
	
	- Bug fix: FileSpec::extractDayTime() now initializes
	  DayTimes generated from file name to have zero hours,
	  zero minutes, zero seconds, etc.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS now more robust when accepting
	  a year number as a hint to disambiguate which full GPS
	  week to use.
	
	- Added more DayTime tests.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime user-defined tolerance for comparisons now is
	  working.

	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS(short week, long zcount, short year)
	  now works across a year rollover.
	
        - Renamed WxObsData::find(...) to getWxObservation(...) to remove
          any confusion that might develop over having the same method
          name as the STL.
	
	- Bug fix: satellite combinations in RAIM sometimes incorrect when 
	  a user-marked satellite was present.

	- Some Vector routines were throwing Exception instead of 
	  VectorException.

	- Added Vector-Matrix concatentation operators.

	- Added a sub-Vector constructor.

	- Modification to Householder decomposition routine.
	
	- Various fixes to MatrixOperators.

	- Updates to FIC routines.

	- Implemented azimuth and elevation functions in Position, making 
	  use of the functions inherited from Triple. Modified EphemerisRange
	  to use Position, as well as TropModel and ResCor; this eliminated 
	  a bug in the azimuth() in EphemerisRange and means that now there 
	  is only one implementation of az and el. Added a test of the new 
	  routines in positiontest. Also added a Position constructor from Xvt.

	- Bugs in DayTime::setToString() - %f was missing (!) and %S 
	  was acting as %f should; date was trashed when time was set, 
	  and vice versa, and year input was not properly handled.

        - Implemented ionospheric model types other than linear.

	- Cleaned up weather data handling (e.g., error checks).

	
	Application modifications
        -------------------------
	
	apps/difftools

	- Unified code using a common class.


	apps/filetools

	- Improvments to navdmp.

	- New utility called rinexthin for subsampling RINEX observation
	  files.

	
	apps/binding
	
	- This  new project provides GPSTk bindings in other languages
	  has been added. This capability is in an alpha state.
	  Currently there are a limited set of bindings for
	  Tcl/Tk, Python and Octave.

	
	apps/RinexEditor

	-  Bug fix: 'delete all' command was being deleted prematurely.


	apps/RinexPlot

	- Improved documentation.
        
	- Various tweaks.

	- Plotting improvements.


	apps/ionosphere

	- Various improvements.
