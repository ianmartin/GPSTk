Version 1.4   Tuesday, December 18, 2007

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Majority of version 1.4 comprised of revision number 863 
	  branching took place under revision 864 from dev/ to RC1.4/
	
	- Major refactoring of the Ephemeris/Almanac classes. This change may 
	     break some apps. To fix them the following translations are useful:
	
              Old                           |        New
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    gpstk::EphemerisStore		    | gpstk::XvtStore<gpstk::SatID>
    gpstk::BCEphemerisStore		    | gpstk::GPSEphemerisStore
    gpstk::AlmanacStore                     | gpstk::GPSAlmanacStore
    gpstk::EphemerisStore::NoEphemerisFound | gpstk::InvalidRequest
    eph.getSatXvt(sat, time)	            | eph.getXvt(sat, time)
    eph.getSatXvt(prn, time)		    | eph.getXvt(SatID(prn, SatID::systemGPS), time)
    eph.dump(0, cout)			    | eph.dump(cout, 0)


        - Added an updated LaTeX source for table describing apps of v1.3, 
	        as well as a list of classes in the gpstk libraries 
	        (sorted & categorized) found in ref/glance/

	- Added LeTex source for the GPSTk paper at the ION-GNSS-2006

	- Added a library /dev/lib/vplot/ to create drawing primitives in SVG 
	        and postscript formats. Intended to support complex, fully 
	        customizable visualizations on GNSS analyses. 

	- Improved version control 
	  * set gpstk package version to 1.3 in the autoconf build world
	  * set the current shared library major version to 13, so gpstk 1.3
	    delivers lib{gpstk,rxio,mdplib,...}.so.13.0
	  * now allows jam and make to build shared libraries with the 
	    appropriate versions
	  * causes jam to install headers to $PREFIX/include/gpstk to prevent 
	    header namespace collision. This behaviour is consistent with the 
	    "make" build.

	- Moved apps/geomatics/lib library to dev/lib/geomatics

Version 1.1   Friday, January 7, 2005

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Added patches to support more compilers:
	     GNU compiler version 3.4
	     GNU compiler under AIX
	     Sun ONE Studio 8

	- GNU make/configure capabilities have been added. Since this
	  is a new feature, your mileage may vary. The makefiles
	  work on systems with newer autoconf toolchain versions.

	- More examples were added to gpstk/examples.
	  These examples are described in the website.

	- Major revamp of the website.
	
	Library modifications
	---------------------

	- P code generator was allocating over 20 megabytes in
	  processes that use the shared library. Now the 20 megabytes
	  are not allocated until the P code generator is initialized
	  by the user.
	
	- Bug fix: FileSpec::extractDayTime() now initializes
	  DayTimes generated from file name to have zero hours,
	  zero minutes, zero seconds, etc.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS now more robust when accepting
	  a year number as a hint to disambiguate which full GPS
	  week to use.
	
	- Added more DayTime tests.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime user-defined tolerance for comparisons now is
	  working.

	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS(short week, long zcount, short year)
	  now works across a year rollover.
	
	- Renamed WxObsData::find(...) to getWxObservation(...) to remove
	  any confusion that might develop over having the same method
	  name as the STL.
	
	- Bug fix: satellite combinations in RAIM sometimes incorrect when 
	  a user-marked satellite was present.

	- Some Vector routines were throwing Exception instead of 
	  VectorException.

	- Added Vector-Matrix concatentation operators.

	- Added a sub-Vector constructor.

	- Modification to Householder decomposition routine.
	
	- Various fixes to MatrixOperators.

	- Updates to FIC routines.

	- Implemented azimuth and elevation functions in Position, making 
	  use of the functions inherited from Triple. Modified EphemerisRange
	  to use Position, as well as TropModel and ResCor; this eliminated 
	  a bug in the azimuth() in EphemerisRange and means that now there 
	  is only one implementation of az and el. Added a test of the new 
	  routines in positiontest. Also added a Position constructor from Xvt.

	- Bugs in DayTime::setToString() - %f was missing (!) and %S 
	  was acting as %f should; date was trashed when time was set, 
	  and vice versa, and year input was not properly handled.

	- Implemented ionospheric model types other than linear.

	- Cleaned up weather data handling (e.g., error checks).

	
	Application modifications

	apps/difftools

	  Currently there are a limited set of bindings for
	  Tcl/Tk, Python and Octave.
