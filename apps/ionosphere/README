   Program IonoBias reads Rinex data files containing extended Rinex 
observation types EL, LA, LO and SR or SS (see preprocessing, below) from 
several sites and estimates biases in the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) measurements imposed by the hardware: either by satellite (the satellite + receiver combined bias) or by receiver alone (average over satellites to get the receiver bias). IonoBias does this by assuming a simple model of the ionosphere and simultaneously estimating biases and model parameters.

   Program TECMaps reads Rinex data files containing extended Rinex observation
types EL, AZ and SR or VR from several sites and at each epoch fits the ver-
tical TEC data to a model of the ionosphere on a two-dimensional grid surface.
Hardware TEC measurement biases are corrected, using input from the program
IonoBias. The user can specify the type of grid, the type of TEC data and the
model to be used. Output is in the form of files, one per epoch, which can be
used to plot the 2D ionospheric TEC surface.

   Run these programs at the command prompt with no options to see a summary of the input options.
