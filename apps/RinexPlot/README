RinexPlot (/apps/RinexPlot)

   This directory contains a Perl script which uses the Perl::Tk module to
provide a menu-driven GUI that will plot the data in Rinex observation files.
It makes use of the Rinex tools, found in /apps/Rinextools, by calling them on
the command line from within Perl.

   RinexPlot will run under Unix, Linux and Windows. For Windows, you must
have Perl and Perl::Tk installed on your system; the best place to get these 
(free) is at ActiveState:

http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/ 

Be sure to get Perl::Tk. Normally the Tk module will come with ActivePerl;
you also get a Perl Package Manager which allows you to update your perl,
or you can do this with CPAN. Under Windows you can use the
batch file RinexPlot.bat.

   Two examples are included here, using scripts goRP and goRP1 (Unix), or
goRP.bat and goRP1.bat (Windows).

   Getting started is easy. Run the example scripts (batch files) first. The
GUI is menu and mouse driven, and you can get some brief instructions from the
Help/Topics menu item. You can also provide options on the command line; see
under Help/Topics again, or just look in the example scripts.

   RinexPlot is young; some menu items are yet to be implemented, and it still
has a few rough edges. I expect to it be improved greatly in the near future.
